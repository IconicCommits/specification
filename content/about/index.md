# About

The Iconic Commits specification is inspired by, and based heavily on, the [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification, but using the joyful flare of [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) to make git logs more colorful and add a little splash of fun into everyday development.
